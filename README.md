# ARP Observatory

On July 27 2016, the ARP radio telescope in Atacama, North Chile, focused on a new part of the Southern sky and listened.
Against the even background noise of space, it heard a strong narrow-band signal. This was the first of many sustained radio events, occurring numerous times a day and at the same source frequency.

On August 1 the signal was confirmed to be carrying audio, and there is as-yet, no indication that the source is local. We've been studying both the source signal and the audio it carries ever since.

ARP is a fictitious radio telescope observatory, it's a Twitter & SoundCloud bot which procedurally generates audio, data-visualisations, and the tweets (and occasionally long-exposure photography) of Robert Muir, a scientist who works at ARP, who is obsessive over the audio messages, and who runs the observatory's Twitter account.
